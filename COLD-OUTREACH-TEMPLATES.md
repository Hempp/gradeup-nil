## 1. DM Templates for Athletes

### Template A: High-Profile Athletes (500K+ followers)
**Platform**: Instagram/Twitter DM

```
Hey {{FIRST_NAME}}!

Saw your {{RECENT_ACHIEVEMENT}} - incredible work. But here's what really caught my attention: you're doing all this while maintaining a {{GPA}} GPA in {{MAJOR}}.

Most NIL platforms ignore that. We don't.

GradeUp NIL is a new platform where your academic excellence is part of your brand value. Brands on our platform specifically want to work with scholar-athletes like you.

Early athletes are getting priority brand matching + featured placement.

Would you want to learn more? Takes 5 min to set up a profile.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Why it works**: Acknowledges their fame but pivots to the differentiator - academics as a value driver.

---

### Template B: Dean's List / Academic Award Athletes
**Platform**: Instagram/Twitter DM

```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}}!

Congrats on making {{ACADEMIC_HONOR}} - that's no joke while competing at {{SCHOOL}}.

Quick question: Are brands reaching out to you for NIL deals yet?

If not (or if they're lowballing you), it might be because traditional platforms don't showcase what makes you special - the combo of athletic + academic excellence.

GradeUp NIL was built specifically for scholar-athletes like you. Your GPA becomes part of your profile, and brands who value education find you directly.

Interested in early access? We're onboarding our first 50 athletes now.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Why it works**: Validates their academic achievement as the hook, positions GradeUp as the solution to being undervalued.

---

### Template C: Rising Athletes / D2-D3 / Olympic Sports
**Platform**: Instagram/Twitter DM

```
{{FIRST_NAME}} - saw your {{SPORT}} highlights. Really solid.

Real talk: NIL money usually goes to football/basketball at big schools. But that's changing.

GradeUp NIL is a new platform where brands find athletes based on academics + athletics. A {{SPORT}} athlete with a 3.8 GPA in {{MAJOR}}? EdTech companies, study app brands, tutoring services - they're actively looking for exactly that.

We're building our first athlete roster now. Early athletes get:
- Featured placement on our homepage
- Priority brand matching
- Direct access to our founding team

Interested? Link in bio or I can send more info.

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Why it works**: Addresses the unfair reality of NIL distribution, offers a path forward for underrepresented athletes.

---

## 2. Email Templates for Brands

### Template A: EdTech Companies
**Subject Lines (pick one)**:
- `Scholar-athletes: The influencer segment you're missing`
- `3.9 GPA + 100K followers. Meet {{ATHLETE_NAME}}.`
- `Why Chegg's competitors are signing NIL deals`

```
Subject: Scholar-athletes: The influencer segment you're missing

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

Your target customer is a college student who cares about grades.

So why are you marketing to influencers who don't?

GradeUp NIL is a new platform connecting brands with verified scholar-athletes - students with 3.5+ GPAs who also happen to have built-in audiences of engaged college followers.

Here's what's different:
- Every athlete's GPA is verified (not self-reported)
- Academic achievements featured alongside athletic stats
- Athletes who authentically use study tools, tutoring, etc.

Current roster includes athletes from Stanford, Duke, Michigan, and Ohio State - all with 3.5+ GPAs and combined reach of 1M+ followers.

Example: {{ATHLETE_NAME}}, {{SPORT}} at {{SCHOOL}} - {{GPA}} GPA in {{MAJOR}}, {{FOLLOWER_COUNT}} followers. Her audience? 72% college students.

Would you be open to a 15-min call to discuss how {{COMPANY}} could work with our launch roster?

Best,
{{YOUR_NAME}}
{{YOUR_TITLE}}
GradeUp NIL

P.S. We're offering founding brand partners reduced rates + co-marketing opportunities during our beta.
```

### Template B: Consumer Packaged Goods (CPG) / Sports Nutrition
**Subject Lines (pick one)**:
- `NIL deals that won't embarrass your brand`
- `The athlete partnerships your competitors are ignoring`
- `Scholar-athletes convert 2.3x better. Here's why.`

```
Subject: NIL deals that won't embarrass your brand

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

NIL has been the Wild West. Athletes partying on Instagram, questionable academic standing, brand risk everywhere.

What if you could partner with athletes who:
- Are verified to be in good academic standing
- Have GPAs featured on their profiles (3.5+ minimum)
- Project the discipline and work ethic your brand represents

That's GradeUp NIL.

We've built the first NIL platform specifically for scholar-athletes. Every athlete is triple-verified: enrollment, sport, and GPA.

For {{COMPANY}}, this means:
- Reduced brand risk (no academic scandals)
- Athletes who embody discipline and preparation
- Authentic alignment with peak performance messaging

Our beta roster includes athletes across 12 sports at 20+ D1 programs.

Would it make sense to explore how scholar-athletes could fit into {{COMPANY}}'s influencer strategy?

Best,
{{YOUR_NAME}}
{{YOUR_TITLE}}
GradeUp NIL

### Template C: Local Businesses (Auto Dealers, Restaurants, Services)
**Subject Lines (pick one)**:
- `Partner with {{SCHOOL}} athletes who represent your values`
- `Local NIL: Scholar-athletes from {{CITY}} want to work with you`
- `The {{SCHOOL}} athlete your customers will respect`

```
Subject: Partner with {{SCHOOL}} athletes who represent your values

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

I noticed {{BUSINESS_NAME}} has sponsored local sports before. Smart move - {{CITY}} loves its college athletics.

But here's the thing: not all athlete partnerships are created equal.

GradeUp NIL connects local businesses with scholar-athletes - student-athletes from {{SCHOOL}} who excel in both sports AND academics.

Why does this matter for {{BUSINESS_NAME}}?

1. Community respect: These athletes represent what {{CITY}} values - hard work, discipline, excellence
2. Role models: Parents want their kids to look up to them
3. Professional: They show up prepared, on time, and represent your brand well

Current {{SCHOOL}} athletes on our platform:
- {{ATHLETE_1}}: {{SPORT}}, {{GPA}} GPA, {{MAJOR}}
- {{ATHLETE_2}}: {{SPORT}}, {{GPA}} GPA, {{MAJOR}}

NIL deals can be as simple as:
- Social media shoutout ($200-500)
- Appearance at your store ($300-800)
- Ongoing ambassador deal ($500-2000/mo)

Want to see which {{SCHOOL}} scholar-athletes might be a fit for {{BUSINESS_NAME}}?

Best,
{{YOUR_NAME}}
{{YOUR_TITLE}}
GradeUp NIL

P.S. Local businesses get a 90-day pilot with no platform fees - just pay the athlete directly.

## 3. Email Template for Athletic Directors

**Subject Lines (pick one)**:
- `NIL platform built with compliance in mind`

- `Re: NIL disclosure + academic verification`

```
Subject: NIL platform built with compliance in mind

Dear {{TITLE}} {{LAST_NAME}},

I'm reaching out regarding GradeUp NIL, a new NIL platform designed specifically to highlight and reward academic achievement alongside athletic performance.

Unlike traditional NIL marketplaces, GradeUp was built with compliance and academic culture as core priorities.

Here's what makes us different:

**For Compliance:**
- Full disclosure dashboard for your office
- Real-time NIL activity tracking for your athletes
- Automated reporting compatible with INFLCR, Opendorse, and direct export
- All deals are documented and transparent

**For Academic Culture:**
- Athletes must maintain 3.0+ GPA to remain active
- Academic achievements featured prominently on profiles
- Brands on our platform specifically seek scholar-athletes
- Reinforces the "student" in student-athlete

**For Your Athletes:**
- Access to brand partnerships that value their complete identity
- Differentiation from athletes on GPA-blind platforms
- Mentorship from our advisory team on personal branding

We're currently onboarding our founding partner schools and would welcome the opportunity to discuss how GradeUp NIL aligns with {{SCHOOL}}'s commitment to academic excellence.

Would you or a member of your compliance team be available for a 20-minute call next week?

Respectfully,
{{YOUR_NAME}}

## 4. LinkedIn Message for NIL Collective Leads

### Initial Connection Request

```
Hi {{FIRST_NAME}} - Saw you're leading {{COLLECTIVE_NAME}} at {{SCHOOL}}. Impressive what you've built for those athletes.

I'm with GradeUp NIL - we're taking a different angle on the NIL space by focusing on scholar-athletes (3.5+ GPA, verified academics).

Think there could be some interesting co-marketing or athlete pipeline opportunities. Would you be open to connecting?

{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

### Follow-Up After Connection

```
Thanks for connecting, {{FIRST_NAME}}.

Quick context on GradeUp NIL: We're the first NIL platform where academic achievement is part of the athlete's brand value. Every athlete is GPA-verified, and we attract brands (especially EdTech, professional services, etc.) that specifically want scholar-athletes.

Why this matters for {{COLLECTIVE_NAME}}:

1. **Complementary positioning** - You likely have high-profile athletes. We can help your academic stars get deals too.

2. **Brand diversity** - Our brand partners are different from typical NIL sponsors. Cross-referrals = more opportunities.

3. **PR angle** - "Scholar-athlete NIL" is a fresh story. Joint announcements could get coverage.

Would you have 15 minutes for a call to explore if there's a fit?

Either way - happy to share any insights from our side of the market.

{{YOUR_NAME}}

## 5. Follow-Up Sequences

### Athlete Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 3 - Touch 2:**
```
Hey {{FIRST_NAME}} - just wanted to bump this up. No pressure, but we're closing our founding athlete spots this week.

If academics are a big part of who you are, GradeUp might be worth 5 minutes.

Happy to answer any questions!
```

**Day 7 - Touch 3:**
```
Last one from me, {{FIRST_NAME}}!

Just wanted to say - whether you join GradeUp or not, keep crushing it in the classroom. Not enough athletes get recognized for that.

Best of luck this season.

### Brand Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 4 - Touch 2:**
```
Subject: Re: Scholar-athletes for {{COMPANY}}

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

Following up on my note about scholar-athlete partnerships.

Quick update: We just onboarded {{NEW_ATHLETE}} ({{SPORT}}, {{SCHOOL}}, {{GPA}} GPA) who would be a strong fit for {{COMPANY}}'s upcoming {{CAMPAIGN/SEASON}}.

Would it be worth a 10-minute call to discuss?

Best,
{{YOUR_NAME}}

P.S. I can also send a custom deck with athlete profiles matched to your target demographic.
```

**Day 10 - Touch 3:**
```
Subject: Re: Scholar-athletes for {{COMPANY}}

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

I know inboxes are brutal, so I'll keep this short.

GradeUp NIL = NIL platform for scholar-athletes (3.5+ GPA verified).

If {{COMPANY}} is exploring influencer marketing to college students, especially students who care about academics, we might be worth a conversation.

If not the right time, no worries - happy to reconnect next quarter.

Best,
{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Day 21 - Touch 4 (Breakup Email):**
```
Subject: Closing the loop

Hi {{FIRST_NAME}},

I've reached out a few times about GradeUp NIL - I'll assume the timing isn't right.

Totally understand. I'll keep you on our quarterly newsletter so you can see how we're growing (unsubscribe anytime).

If scholar-athlete partnerships ever become a priority for {{COMPANY}}, feel free to reply to any of my emails.

Wishing you a great {{QUARTER/SEASON}}.

Best,
{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

### Athletic Director Follow-Up Sequence

**Day 5 - Touch 2:**
```
Subject: Re: NIL platform built with compliance in mind

{{TITLE}} {{LAST_NAME}},

Following up on my previous note about GradeUp NIL.

I wanted to share that we recently published our Compliance Integration Guide, which details how our platform handles:
- NIL disclosure and reporting
- Academic eligibility verification
- Integration with existing compliance tools

Would it be helpful if I sent this over? Happy to schedule a brief call to walk through it with your team.

Respectfully,
{{YOUR_NAME}}
```

**Day 12 - Touch 3:**
```
Subject: GradeUp NIL - One more thought

{{TITLE}} {{LAST_NAME}},

One final note, then I'll step back.

We're currently offering founding partner schools:
- Waived platform fees for the first year
- Dedicated compliance liaison
- Custom reporting to match your office's requirements
- Co-branded announcements celebrating your scholar-athletes

If {{SCHOOL}} would benefit from an NIL platform that reinforces academic culture rather than undermining it, I'd welcome the chance to discuss.

If now isn't the right time, I completely understand. Happy to reconnect in the future.

Respectfully,
{{YOUR_NAME}}

## Tips for Execution

### For Athlete DMs:
1. **Personalize the achievement** - Find something specific from the last 2 weeks
2. **Don't ask for too much** - "5 minutes" or "early access" is the ask
3. **Time it right** - After a win, after Dean's List announcements, during off-season
4. **Follow them first** - Look less spammy if you're already engaged with their content

### For Brand Emails:
1. **Research the contact** - Marketing Manager > CMO for cold outreach
2. **Reference their current strategy** - "I noticed {{COMPANY}} worked with {{ATHLETE}}"
3. **Keep subject lines short** - Under 50 characters, create curiosity
4. **Send Tuesday-Thursday** - 9-11am recipient's timezone

### For Athletic Directors:
1. **Formal tone always** - They deal with enough informal NIL chaos
2. **Lead with compliance** - That's their #1 concern
3. **CC compliance officer** - If you can find them on staff page
4. **Be patient** - These are 60-day sales cycles minimum

### For NIL Collectives:
1. **Acknowledge their success** - They've built something, respect it
2. **Position as complementary** - Not competitive
3. **Offer value first** - Insights, data, co-marketing before asking for anything

### The Problem

The NIL era has created unprecedented opportunities for student-athletes, but also new challenges:

- **Academic Distraction**: NIL opportunities often compete with classroom focus
- **Inequity**: Only high-follower athletes benefit from traditional platforms
- **Values Misalignment**: NIL messaging can undermine academic expectations
- **Culture Tension**: Team dynamics strained when NIL favors certain athletes

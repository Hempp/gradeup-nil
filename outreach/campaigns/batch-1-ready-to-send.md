## Priority Tier: Academic Excellence Leaders

These 10 schools were selected for strongest academic mission alignment.

---

### EMAIL 1: Vanderbilt University
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGHEST (Best academic fit in SEC)

**To:** Candice Lee <athletics@vanderbilt.edu>
**Subject:** Vanderbilt Athletes: NIL That Reinforces Your Academic Mission

---

Dear Candice,

Vanderbilt occupies a unique position in the SEC—the conference's academic standard-bearer. That's exactly why I wanted to reach out about GradeUp NIL.

**The Challenge We're Solving:**

The NIL landscape has created tremendous opportunities for student-athletes, but it's also introduced concerns about how it affects academic focus. As the athletic director at the SEC's most academically rigorous institution, I imagine you're looking for NIL solutions that reinforce—rather than undermine—Vanderbilt's values.

**Introducing GradeUp NIL:**

GradeUp is the first NIL platform built specifically around academic achievement:

- **GPA-Based Earnings:** Student-athletes earn NIL compensation directly tied to their academic performance
- **Scholar Tiers:** Bronze (3.0+), Silver (3.3+), Gold (3.6+), Platinum (3.9+) unlock progressively better deals
- **Team Culture:** Reinforces the message that being a student-athlete means excelling at both
- **Compliance-First:** Fully compliant with NCAA guidelines

**Why This Matters for Vanderbilt:**

Vanderbilt consistently leads the SEC in graduation rates and APR scores. GradeUp gives you a tool to showcase that commitment while helping your student-athletes earn what they deserve—not in spite of their academics, but because of them.

Schools using GradeUp have seen an average 0.3 GPA increase among participating athletes within the first year.

I'd love to share a brief 15-minute overview. Would you have availability for a quick call this week?

Warm regards,

### EMAIL 2: Stanford University
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGHEST (Academic gold standard)

**To:** Bernard Muir <athletics@stanford.edu>
**Subject:** A New Way to Reward Stanford Student-Athletes for Academic Excellence

---

Dear Bernard,

Stanford's commitment to developing leaders who excel in athletics, academics, and life is unparalleled. That philosophy is exactly why I'm reaching out about GradeUp NIL.

**The Opportunity:**

What if NIL could actively reinforce Stanford's academic mission instead of competing with it? That's the premise behind GradeUp—the first NIL platform where a student-athlete's GPA directly unlocks better brand deals.

**How It Works:**

- **GPA-Based Matching:** Higher grades = access to premium brand partnerships
- **Scholar Recognition:** Public celebration of academic achievement alongside athletic success
- **Olympic Sport Athletes:** Unlike follower-based NIL, GradeUp gives your non-revenue sport athletes equal earning potential based on their academic excellence
- **Values Alignment:** Brands on our platform specifically seek student-athletes who represent academic excellence

**Why Stanford:**

Your athletic department has 20+ varsity programs filled with exceptional students. Traditional NIL platforms favor high-follower athletes from revenue sports. GradeUp's academic-first model means your swimmer with a 3.9 GPA in pre-med has real NIL earning potential—something not possible on conventional platforms.

Would you be open to a 15-minute conversation about how GradeUp could serve Stanford student-athletes?

### EMAIL 3: University of Notre Dame
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGHEST (Strong values alignment)

**To:** Pete Bevacqua <athletics@nd.edu>
**Subject:** Notre Dame Athletes: NIL That Reflects Your Values

---

Dear Pete,

Notre Dame's commitment to developing the whole person—mind, body, and spirit—sets it apart in college athletics. I'm reaching out because GradeUp NIL was built with exactly that philosophy in mind.

**The Challenge:**

The NIL era has created incredible opportunities, but also tension for programs that prioritize character and academics. How do you embrace NIL while staying true to Notre Dame's mission?

**Our Solution:**

GradeUp is the only NIL platform where academic achievement is the primary driver of earning potential:

- **GPA-Unlocked Deals:** Student-athletes with higher GPAs access better brand partnerships
- **Character Recognition:** Brands on our platform seek student-athletes who exemplify excellence in all areas
- **Mission Alignment:** NIL becomes a reward for being the complete student-athlete Notre Dame develops

**Why Notre Dame:**

Your student-athletes consistently rank among the highest in graduation rates and academic honors. GradeUp gives them a way to monetize that excellence while reinforcing the values that make Notre Dame special.

I believe there's strong alignment between what GradeUp offers and what Notre Dame represents. Would you be open to a brief conversation?

God bless,

### EMAIL 4: Duke University
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH

**To:** Nina King <athletics@duke.edu>
**Subject:** Duke Athletes: NIL Built Around Academic Excellence

---

Dear Nina,

Congratulations on your leadership at Duke—a program that proves elite athletics and elite academics aren't mutually exclusive. That's precisely why I wanted to introduce you to GradeUp NIL.

**The Concept:**

GradeUp is the first NIL platform where a student-athlete's academic performance directly determines their earning potential. Higher GPA = access to better brand deals.

**Why This Works for Duke:**

1. **Academic Credibility:** Your student-athletes are among the best students in the country—GradeUp lets them capitalize on that
2. **Olympic Sports Equity:** Your non-revenue sport athletes (who often have the highest GPAs) can finally compete in the NIL space
3. **Recruiting Message:** "At Duke, your academics make you money" is a powerful differentiator
4. **Brand Alignment:** Premium brands seek Duke-caliber student-athletes for their reputation

**The Ask:**

I'd love 15 minutes to show you how GradeUp could amplify Duke's academic-athletic excellence. Would next week work for a brief call?

Best,

### EMAIL 5: Northwestern University
**Priority:** 🔴 HIGH (Unique positioning in Big Ten)

**To:** Mark Jackson <athletics@northwestern.edu>
**Subject:** Northwestern's Academic Edge in NIL

---

Dear Mark,

Northwestern holds a unique position in the Big Ten—competing at the highest level while maintaining academic standards that rival the Ivies. GradeUp NIL was built to reward exactly that combination.

**The Problem We Solve:**

Traditional NIL platforms favor athletes with massive social followings, typically from football and basketball at the largest programs. This leaves Northwestern's exceptional student-athletes—many in rigorous academic programs—underserved.

**Our Approach:**

GradeUp flips the script. Academic performance is the primary driver:

- **GPA-Based Tiers:** Higher grades unlock premium brand partnerships
- **Major Recognition:** STEM and pre-professional students earn additional credibility with corporate partners
- **Fair Platform:** Your soccer player with a 3.8 in engineering competes equally with any athlete on the platform

**The Northwestern Advantage:**

Your student-athletes are already doing the hard work academically. GradeUp gives them a platform where that work translates directly to NIL earning potential—something no other platform offers.

Could we schedule 15 minutes to discuss how this could benefit Northwestern athletes?

### EMAIL 6: University of Michigan
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**To:** Warde Manuel <athletics@umich.edu>
**Subject:** Michigan Athletes: Where Academic Excellence Meets NIL

---

Dear Warde,

Michigan's Leaders and Best aren't just a fight song—they're a standard. That's why I'm introducing you to GradeUp NIL, where academic excellence drives NIL success.

**The Opportunity:**

Michigan already develops exceptional student-athletes. GradeUp gives you a tool to reward and reinforce that development with NIL opportunities tied directly to academic performance.

**How It Works:**

- Student-athletes with higher GPAs unlock access to premium brand deals
- Academic achievements are showcased alongside athletic accomplishments
- Brands specifically seeking "student" in student-athlete find their partners on GradeUp

**Why Michigan:**

With one of the largest athletic departments in the country and a storied academic reputation, Michigan is positioned to lead in academic-first NIL. Imagine the recruiting advantage: "At Michigan, your GPA makes you money."

I'd welcome the chance to show you a brief demo. Would you have 15 minutes this week or next?

### EMAIL 7: Penn State University
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH

**To:** Patrick Kraft <athletics@psu.edu>
**Subject:** NIL That Reinforces Penn State's Academic Tradition

---

Dear Patrick,

Penn State's tradition of developing well-rounded student-athletes—succeeding in competition, the classroom, and life—is something to be proud of. GradeUp NIL was designed to amplify that mission.

**The Platform:**

GradeUp is the first NIL solution where academic performance unlocks earning potential. Higher GPA = better brand partnerships.

**Why This Fits Penn State:**

1. **Scale:** With 800+ varsity athletes, you need NIL solutions that work for everyone—not just stars with social media followings
2. **Values:** NIL that reinforces your academic expectations rather than competing with them
3. **Alumni Network:** Penn State's massive alumni base values the complete student-athlete—GradeUp highlights that

**The Model:**

- Bronze Tier (3.0+) → Entry brand access
- Silver Tier (3.3+) → Premium regional brands
- Gold Tier (3.6+) → National brand partnerships
- Platinum Tier (3.9+) → Elite opportunities

Would you be open to learning more? I'm happy to arrange a brief overview call.

### EMAIL 8: University of Texas
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH (Major NIL market)

**To:** Chris Del Conte <athletics@utexas.edu>
**Subject:** Texas Athletes: The Next Evolution of NIL

---

Dear Chris,

Texas has been at the forefront of NIL, showing the country what's possible when elite athletics meets a major market. I'd like to introduce the next evolution: NIL that rewards academic excellence.

**GradeUp NIL:**

We're the first platform where a student-athlete's GPA directly unlocks brand opportunities. It's not replacing what Texas is already doing—it's adding a dimension that differentiates your program.

**The Value for Texas:**

1. **Differentiation:** Every major program offers NIL. Few can say "our NIL reinforces academics."
2. **Recruiting Edge:** Academic-minded families hear: "At Texas, your grades unlock earning potential."
3. **Culture Tool:** NIL becomes part of your academic support system, not a distraction from it
4. **Complete Athlete:** Brands on GradeUp specifically want student-athletes who represent excellence everywhere

**The Ask:**

Texas is already doing NIL at scale. GradeUp could add academic-first NIL to your toolkit. Worth a 15-minute conversation?

### EMAIL 9: Ohio State University
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH (Largest athletic department)

**To:** Gene Smith <athletics@osu.edu>
**Subject:** Academic NIL at Scale: An Opportunity for Ohio State

---

Dear Gene,

As the leader of the nation's largest athletic department, you've seen every NIL approach imaginable. I'd like to show you one that reinforces—rather than competes with—Ohio State's commitment to student-athlete development.

**GradeUp NIL:**

We're the only platform where academic performance is the primary driver of NIL opportunity. Higher GPA = access to better brand partnerships.

**Why This Works at Ohio State's Scale:**

- **600+ Athletes:** Traditional NIL serves maybe 50 high-profile athletes. GradeUp serves everyone based on academic merit.
- **Olympic Sports:** Your swimmers, wrestlers, and volleyball players with exceptional GPAs can finally compete in NIL.
- **Development Message:** NIL becomes a tool that supports your Total Person Program, not a challenge to it.

**The Opportunity:**

Ohio State leading in academic-first NIL would be a statement. It aligns with your development philosophy and creates a recruiting narrative that no one else can match.

I'd be grateful for 15 minutes to show you how this could work at Ohio State. Would you have availability?

O-H,

### EMAIL 10: University of Georgia
**Priority:** 🟡 HIGH (National champions, SEC credibility)

**To:** Josh Brooks <athletics@uga.edu>
**Subject:** Georgia Athletes: NIL That Matches Your Championship Standard

---

Dear Josh,

Georgia has set the standard for excellence—back-to-back national championships prove that. GradeUp NIL is designed to bring that same standard of excellence to the academic side of NIL.

**The Concept:**

GradeUp is the first NIL platform where academic achievement unlocks earning potential. We're not replacing Georgia's existing NIL infrastructure—we're adding an academic dimension that few programs can match.

**Why Georgia:**

1. **SEC Leadership:** Being first in academic NIL positions Georgia as an SEC leader in student-athlete development, not just athletics
2. **Complete Champions:** Championships are won by disciplined student-athletes. GradeUp rewards that discipline.
3. **Recruiting:** "At Georgia, your grades open doors" is a message that resonates with families
4. **Culture:** NIL that reinforces academic expectations rather than competing with them

**The Model:**

Student-athletes with higher GPAs access premium brand partnerships. Simple. Powerful. Aligned with your values.

Would you have 15 minutes for a brief conversation? I'd love to show you how this could work for Georgia.

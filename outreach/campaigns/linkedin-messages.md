## Follow-Up Message (After Connection Accepted)

### Template: Value-First Approach
```
[First Name], thanks for connecting!

I wanted to share a quick stat: schools using GradeUp have seen a 0.3 GPA increase among participating athletes within the first year.

The model is simple—student-athletes with higher GPAs unlock better brand partnerships. It reinforces the message that excellence in the classroom matters.

Would you be open to a 15-minute overview? I think [School] could be a great fit.

Happy to work around your schedule.

Best,
[Your Name]
```

### Template: If They Engage with Your Content
```
[First Name], noticed you [liked/commented on] my post about academic NIL.

We're seeing real momentum with programs that prioritize student-athlete development. Would love to share what we're learning and hear [School]'s perspective.

Any chance for a brief call this week?

## Content Strategy (Post These on LinkedIn)

### Post 1: The Problem
```
🎓 The NIL Paradox:

We tell student-athletes to focus on academics.
Then we reward them based on Instagram followers.

There's a better way.

#NIL #CollegeAthletics #StudentAthletes
```

### Post 2: The Solution
```
What if NIL actually reinforced academic excellence?

That's exactly what we're building at GradeUp:

→ Higher GPA = Better brand deals
→ Academic achievement = Earning potential
→ The "student" in student-athlete matters

The future of NIL is academic-first.

#NIL #CollegeAthletics #AcademicExcellence
```

### Post 3: The Data
```
Early data from GradeUp schools:

📈 0.3 average GPA increase among participants
📈 94% maintain or improve academic standing
📈 Athletes in STEM majors earning 40% more

When you reward academics, athletes rise to the occasion.

#NIL #CollegeAthletics #DataDriven
```

### Post 4: Athletic Director Focus
```
Talked to 20+ athletic directors last month.

The #1 concern about NIL: "How do we keep our athletes focused on academics?"

Their biggest opportunity: Using NIL to reinforce—not undermine—academic expectations.

That's exactly why we built GradeUp.

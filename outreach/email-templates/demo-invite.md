## No-Show Follow-Up

**Subject:** Sorry we missed each other - reschedule?

Hi [AD First Name],

I hope everything is okay—I know how hectic things can get in athletics.

I was looking forward to our demo today. Would you like to reschedule for later this week or next?

Here's my calendar link to make it easy: [Calendly Link]

Alternatively, I've attached a 2-minute video overview in case a quick watch is more convenient than a live call right now.

Let me know what works best!

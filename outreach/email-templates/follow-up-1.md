Hi [AD First Name],

I wanted to follow up on my previous email about GradeUp NIL. I know your schedule is incredibly demanding, especially during [current season/time of year], so I'll keep this brief.

**One Quick Story:**

Last semester, a junior linebacker at one of our partner schools was struggling to balance his athletic and academic commitments. Through GradeUp, he saw a direct financial benefit to improving his grades. He went from a 2.4 to a 3.1 GPA—not because he had to, but because he wanted to.

His coach told us: *"For the first time, NIL actually helped my player become a better student, not just a better-known athlete."*

**That's what GradeUp does differently.**

I'd be happy to:
- Share a 2-minute video overview (no call required)
- Set up a quick 15-minute intro call at your convenience
- Send over our one-page program summary

What works best for you?

Best,

[Your Name]

P.S. If you'd prefer I reach out to your Associate AD for Student-Athlete Development or your compliance team instead, just let me know who would be the best contact.

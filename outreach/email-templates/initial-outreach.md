Dear [AD First Name],

I hope this message finds you well. I'm reaching out because I believe [School Name] shares our commitment to developing student-athletes who excel both on the field and in the classroom.

**The Challenge We're Solving:**

The NIL landscape has created tremendous opportunities for student-athletes, but it has also introduced concerns about how it affects team culture, academic focus, and the student-athlete experience. Many athletic directors have shared with us that they're looking for NIL solutions that reinforce—rather than undermine—their program's values.

**Introducing GradeUp NIL:**

GradeUp is the first NIL platform built specifically around academic achievement. Here's how it works:

- **GPA-Based Earnings:** Student-athletes earn NIL compensation directly tied to their academic performance
- **Semester Milestones:** Rewards increase with sustained academic excellence over time
- **Team Culture:** Reinforces the message that being a student-athlete means excelling at both
- **Compliance-First:** Fully compliant with NCAA guidelines and state NIL laws

**Why Athletic Directors Choose GradeUp:**

1. **Alignment with Institutional Values** - NIL that supports your academic mission
2. **Recruiting Advantage** - Attract student-athletes who value education
3. **Retention Impact** - Athletes with higher GPAs have better graduation rates
4. **Positive PR** - A story worth celebrating about your student-athletes

**The Numbers:**

Schools using GradeUp have seen an average 0.3 GPA increase among participating athletes within the first year, with 94% of participants maintaining or improving their academic standing.

I'd love to share a brief 15-minute overview of how GradeUp could support [School Name]'s student-athletes. Would you have availability for a quick call this week or next?

Warm regards,

Hi [AD First Name],

I'll keep this short—I know you're juggling countless priorities.

I've reached out a couple of times about GradeUp NIL, our GPA-based NIL platform that rewards student-athletes for academic achievement. If the timing isn't right or this isn't a priority for [School Name] right now, I completely understand.

**Before I step back, I wanted to leave you with this:**

The schools that have implemented GradeUp share three things in common:
1. They believe student-athletes should be students first
2. They want NIL to strengthen—not complicate—their team culture
3. They're looking for a competitive recruiting advantage that aligns with their values

If any of that resonates, I'm happy to reconnect whenever it makes sense. No pressure, no aggressive follow-up.

**One easy next step:** Our 2-minute explainer video: [Link]

Wishing you and your teams a successful [season/semester].

Best regards,

P.S. If there's someone else on your team who handles NIL initiatives or student-athlete development programs, I'd be grateful for an introduction.

Subject: "Thought of [School Name] - new GradeUp data"

Hi [AD First Name],

I came across some new data I thought might interest you: schools using GPA-based NIL saw a 23% increase in athletic department graduation rates compared to the previous year.

Given [School Name]'s commitment to student-athlete development, I thought this might be relevant.

Happy to share the full report if useful.

Best,
[Your Name]

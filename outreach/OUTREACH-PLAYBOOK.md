**Target Outcome:** Partner with 25 D1 athletic departments in Year 1, representing 15,000+ student-athletes.

**Key Message:** "NIL that makes student-athletes better students."

## Understanding Athletic Directors

### Who They Are

Athletic Directors at D1 schools are:
- **Executives:** Managing $50M-$200M+ annual budgets
- **Fundraisers:** Constantly engaging donors
- **Politicians:** Navigating university administration, coaches, boosters
- **Brand Managers:** Protecting and growing athletic brand
- **Compliance-Conscious:** NCAA rules are always top of mind
- **Time-Starved:** Pulled in 100 directions daily

### What They Care About

1. **Winning** — Competitive success in major sports
2. **Revenue** — Ticket sales, donations, media rights
3. **Reputation** — University and athletic brand perception
4. **Compliance** — Avoiding NCAA violations
5. **Student-Athlete Welfare** — Genuine care for their athletes
6. **Coaching Staff** — Keeping coaches happy and successful
7. **Facilities** — Capital projects and upgrades

### What Keeps Them Up at Night

- NIL destabilizing team chemistry
- Transfer portal talent flight
- Major compliance issues
- Donor and booster expectations
- Coach demands and contracts
- University administration pressure

### Decision-Making Process

1. **Awareness:** Learn about GradeUp
2. **Interest:** See alignment with values
3. **Evaluation:** Loop in compliance, academic services, possibly coaches
4. **Internal Champions:** Associate AD or academic support advocates
5. **Decision:** AD signs off (sometimes needs university leadership approval)
6. **Implementation:** Handoff to operations team

**Key Insight:** The AD may not be the evaluator, but they are the final approver. Build champions at multiple levels.

## Cold Outreach Strategy

### Multi-Channel Approach

We use a coordinated multi-channel strategy:

```
Email → LinkedIn → Phone → Event/Conference → Referral
```

### Email Strategy

**Sequence:**
1. **Day 0:** Initial outreach email
2. **Day 3:** Follow-up #1 (value story)
3. **Day 7:** Follow-up #2 (soft close)
4. **Day 30:** Re-engagement (new data/news hook)

**Best Practices:**
- Personalize every email (research their school, recent news, academic achievements)
- Keep subject lines under 50 characters
- Front-load the value proposition

**Email Templates:** See `/email-templates/` folder

### Phone Strategy

**When to Call:**
- After 2 emails with no response
- When you have a warm referral
- After they've engaged with content (opened email multiple times, clicked links)

**Phone Script Framework:**

```
"Hi [Name], this is [Your Name] with GradeUp NIL.
I sent you an email earlier this week about our GPA-based NIL platform.

I know you're incredibly busy, so I'll be brief:
We help athletic departments like [School Name] offer NIL opportunities
that actually reinforce your academic mission.

Would you have 15 minutes this week to hear how it works?"
```

**If Voicemail:**
```
"Hi [Name], [Your Name] with GradeUp NIL.

## Objection Handling

### Objection 1: "We already have NIL solutions in place."

**Response:**
> "That's great—most schools we work with have some NIL infrastructure. GradeUp is designed to complement, not replace, those efforts. We focus specifically on the academic angle, which is often missing from traditional NIL. Think of it as adding an academic lane to your NIL program. Schools use GradeUp alongside collective and marketplace NIL—it serves a different purpose: reinforcing that your athletes are students first."

**Follow-Up Question:**
> "What's your current approach to connecting NIL with academic performance?"

---

### Objection 2: "NIL is already complicated enough. We don't need another platform."

**Response:**
> "I completely understand—NIL has added significant complexity. That's actually why GradeUp is valuable: we simplify one part of the equation. There's no athlete-by-athlete deals to manage, no sponsor negotiations, no content creation burden. GPA goes up, athlete gets paid. Our compliance documentation is built-in, and most schools are fully implemented in under 3 weeks."

**Follow-Up Question:**
> "What's taking up most of your NIL bandwidth right now?"

---

### Objection 3: "How do you verify GPAs? That seems complicated."

**Response:**
> "Great question—verification is straightforward. We integrate with your academic services team, typically through a simple roster upload with GPA data at the end of each semester. We don't need access to your SIS or any sensitive systems. Your registrar or academic services coordinator provides a verified report, and we handle the rest. It's usually 15 minutes of work per semester."

**Follow-Up Question:**
> "Would it help to speak with your academic services team to map out exactly how it would work?"

---

### Objection 4: "We don't have budget for another NIL expense."

**Response:**
> "I hear you—budgets are tight everywhere. A few things to consider: First, GradeUp is often funded separately from operating budgets—many schools tap into NIL collective funds, booster donations specifically for academic initiatives, or even institutional advancement budgets. Second, the ROI case is strong: improved graduation rates, better APR scores, and positive PR. I can help you build a business case for internal funding if that's useful."

**Follow-Up Question:**
> "Who typically makes funding decisions for academic support initiatives at [School Name]?"

---

### Objection 5: "Our coaches might not support this."

**Response:**
> "That's a valid concern—coach buy-in matters. Here's what we've found: coaches love GradeUp once they see it in action. It gives them a tool to motivate academic performance without being the 'bad guy.' It reinforces team culture around accountability. And it's not competitive with the NIL their star players are already earning—it's additive. Would it help to do a brief call with your head coach to address any concerns?"

**Follow-Up Question:**
> "Which coaches do you think would be most supportive of this kind of initiative?"

---

### Objection 6: "The amounts you pay probably aren't meaningful to athletes."

**Response:**
> "You'd be surprised. For many athletes—especially non-revenue sport athletes who don't have NIL deals—GradeUp might be their only NIL income. A few hundred dollars per semester is meaningful for books, groceries, and expenses. And beyond the money, it's the message: your academic effort is valued and rewarded. That psychological impact is significant."

**Follow-Up Question:**
> "How are your non-revenue sport athletes currently accessing NIL opportunities?"

---

### Objection 7: "We're in the middle of [season/transition/capital project]. Timing isn't right."

**Response:**
> "Totally understand—timing is everything. Would it make sense to schedule a call for [specific future date] when things calm down? In the meantime, I can send over some materials so you have them when you're ready. We're not going anywhere, and I'd rather connect when you can give it proper attention."

**Follow-Up Question:**
> "When does your [season/project/transition] wrap up? I'll circle back then."

---

### Objection 8: "We need to run this by compliance first."

**Response:**
> "Absolutely—compliance should be involved. We actually encourage it. We've designed GradeUp to be compliance-friendly from day one. We have documentation for every state's NIL laws and NCAA guidelines. Would it help to set up a call that includes your compliance director? I can walk them through exactly how we handle reporting and documentation."

**Follow-Up Question:**
> "Would you like me to send our compliance overview to your compliance team directly?"

---

### Objection 9: "I need to see data proving this works."

**Response:**
> "Fair request. I can share anonymized data from our partner schools showing GPA improvements, athlete participation rates, and satisfaction scores. We also have testimonials from ADs, coaches, and student-athletes. What specific metrics would be most convincing for you?"

**Follow-Up Question:**
> "Would a case study from a [similar conference/similar school type] be most relevant?"

---

### Objection 10: "What if athletes just focus on easy classes to boost their GPA?"

**Response:**
> "It's a thoughtful concern, and it hasn't played out that way in practice. Here's why: athletes still need to make progress toward their degree, meet eligibility requirements, and satisfy their academic advisors. GradeUp doesn't change any of that—it just adds a financial incentive on top. If anything, we've seen athletes engage more with their advisors to plan their course loads strategically, which is a positive outcome."

**Follow-Up Question:**
> "How does your academic support team currently help athletes with course selection?"

## Competitive Positioning

### Landscape Overview

| Category | Examples | GradeUp Differentiation |
|----------|----------|-------------------------|
| NIL Marketplaces | Opendorse, INFLCR | We're not a marketplace—we reward academics, not endorsements |
| NIL Collectives | Various by school | Complementary—we handle the academic angle they don't |
| Compliance Platforms | COMPASS, Athlete Advantage | We're an NIL source, not just a compliance tool |
| Direct Deals | Brands + Athletes | We provide NIL to ALL athletes, not just stars |

### Key Differentiators

1. **Academic Focus:** Only NIL platform built around GPA
2. **Universal Access:** Every athlete can earn, not just marketable stars
3. **Simplicity:** No content creation, no sponsor negotiations
4. **Team Culture:** Builds unity instead of jealousy
5. **Mission Alignment:** Supports institutional academic goals

### Competitive Responses

**"How is this different from [Opendorse/INFLCR]?"**
> "Those are great platforms for athletes doing endorsement deals and brand partnerships. GradeUp is different—we're not a marketplace. We pay athletes directly based on their GPA. There's no content creation, no sponsor matching. It's complementary to marketplace NIL, serving athletes who may not have endorsement opportunities."

**"Our NIL collective already supports athletes."**
> "Collectives do great work, and we're often seen as an extension of collective efforts. The difference is focus: collectives typically prioritize on-field value, while GradeUp focuses purely on academic performance. Many schools use both—the collective for performance-based NIL and GradeUp for academic-based NIL."
